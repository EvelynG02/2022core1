            <ul>
                -‚ÄúIn this age of digital cacophony dominated by these (social media)platforms, no one is looking out for you‚Ä¶ but you.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
                -‚ÄúWhatever it is, there is potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
                -‚ÄúArtists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and then, when they share their work, for others. Of course, world-building means creating everything‚Äînot only making things inside the world but also the surrounding world itself‚Äîthe language, style, rules, and architecture.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
            -‚ÄúIn an age of information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists of all types are the people to help. Artists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
            -I often think about website design in one of two ways, creatively or commercially. In trying to move away from the two ideas and bring them together. How can we as designers think more expansively about what a website can be? To think of websites as identity helps when designing.

            <ul>
                -‚ÄúTo generalize from this, the first position (working ‚Äúon‚Äù) is labeled modern or, when applied to art and aesthetics, modernist. And the latter position (working ‚Äúwithin‚Äù) is labeled non-modern, be it premodern, postmodern, or some other alternative.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
                -‚ÄúAnd they are technologists who insist that the beauty of code comes not from function and elegance but from a different set of virtues‚Äîdysfunction and inelegance to be sure, but also confusion and excitement, violence and energy. The result is not so much a mechanization of art, nor that clumsy concept ‚Äúthe art of the machine,‚Äù but a much more simple and mundane reality: the computer as medium.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
                -‚ÄúASCII art arranges the letters and punctuation of the ASCII character set into a crude palette of tones from light to dark, drawing pictures from the tones‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>-Trying to be a modern designer means to design in a way that uses the computer itself as a medium and embracing what can be created with code. The author claims that ASCII art is crude, but how  is it crude when it is showing off the character itself in a non functioning format? I argue that it adds a spotlight to the visual of the character itself by not necesarrily giving the audience something to interact with. </ul>

            <ul>
                -‚ÄúMy point is that the mainstream is no longer defined by cultural touchstones, it is defined by platforms. Regardless of your feed, scrolling through twitter because you may find a funny sentence or interesting recommendation is not that different from watching hours of TV hoping for that one good commercial. The only real difference is that no one watches TV anymore.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
                -‚ÄúThe folk practices of our nerdy grandparents, the people who designed and defined the world wide web, are the tools we can use realize this world. I am so excited to learn and practice them.‚Äù
            </ul>
            <ul>
            -This reading was my favorite as it gives insight to the art of code and the web. Our daily social sites are packed to the brim with ads, forcing us to view the web as a buy sell or promote platform and not a platform for the art of code to be appreciated itself.
